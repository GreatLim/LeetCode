# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

## Description

Given a binary tree

```
struct TreeLinkNode {
  TreeLinkNode *left;
  TreeLinkNode *right;
  TreeLinkNode *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Note:**

- You may only use constant extra space.
- Recursive approach is fine, implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
- You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).

**Example:**

Given the following perfect binary tree,

```
     1
   /  \
  2    3
 / \  / \
4  5  6  7
```

After calling your function, the tree should look like:

```
     1 -> NULL
   /  \
  2 -> 3 -> NULL
 / \  / \
4->5->6->7 -> NULL
```

## Solution

```java
/**
 * Definition for binary tree with next pointer.
 * public class TreeLinkNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeLinkNode left, right, next;
 *     TreeLinkNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public void connect(TreeLinkNode root) {
        if(root == null || root.left == null) return;
        root.left.next = root.right;
        if(root.next != null)
            root.right.next = root.next.left;
        connect(root.left);
        connect(root.right);
    }
}
```
