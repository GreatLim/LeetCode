# 53. Maximum Subarray

## Description

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

```
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

If you have figured out the O(*n*) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.



## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int maxSoFar = nums[0];
        int maxHere = nums[0]; 
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            maxHere = Math.max(nums[i], maxHere + nums[i]);
            maxSoFar = Math.max(maxHere, maxSoFar);
        }
        return maxSoFar;
    }
}
```



## Notes

* this problem was discussed by Jon Bentley (Sep. 1984 Vol. 27 No. 9 Communications of the ACM P885)

  the paragraph below was copied from his paper (with a little modifications)

  algorithm that operates on arrays: it starts at the left end (element A[1]) and scans through to the right end (element A[n]), keeping track of the maximum sum subvector seen so far. The maximum is initially A[0]. Suppose we've solved the problem for A[1 .. i - 1]; how can we extend that to A[1 .. i]? The maximum
  sum in the first I elements is either the maximum sum in the first i - 1 elements (which we'll call MaxSoFar), or it is that of a subvector that ends in position i (which we'll call MaxEndingHere).

  MaxEndingHere is either A[i] plus the previous MaxEndingHere, or just A[i], whichever is larger.
