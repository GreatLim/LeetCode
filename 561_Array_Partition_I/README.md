# 561. Array Partition I

## Description

Given an array of **2n** integers, your task is to group these integers into **n** pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
```

**Note:**

1. **n** is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].
2. All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i+=2)
            res += nums[i];
        return res;
    }
}
```



## Notes

The algorithm is first sort the input array and then the sum of 1st, 3rd, 5th..., is the answer.

```
public class Solution {
    public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2) {
            result += nums[i];
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

Let me try to prove the algorithm...

1. Assume in each pair `i`, `bi >= ai`.
2. Denote `Sm = min(a1, b1) + min(a2, b2) + ... + min(an, bn)`. The biggest `Sm` is the answer of this problem. Given `1`, `Sm = a1 + a2 + ... + an`.
3. Denote `Sa = a1 + b1 + a2 + b2 + ... + an + bn`. `Sa` is constant for a given input.
4. Denote `di = |ai - bi|`. Given `1`, `di = bi - ai`. Denote `Sd = d1 + d2 + ... + dn`.
5. So `Sa = a1 + a1 + d1 + a2 + a2 + d2 + ... + an + an + dn = 2Sm + Sd` => `Sm = (Sa - Sd) / 2`. To get the max `Sm`, given `Sa` is constant, we need to make `Sd` as small as possible.
6. So this problem becomes finding pairs in an array that makes sum of `di` (distance between `ai` and `bi`) as small as possible. Apparently, sum of these distances of adjacent elements is the smallest. If that's not intuitive enough, see attached picture. Case 1 has the smallest `Sd`.
